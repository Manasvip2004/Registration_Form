The Registration Form experiment in React Native Expo with Tailwind CSS focuses on
designing a user-friendly and responsive form for collecting user details. It utilizes React
Native components like TextInput, TouchableOpacity, and Modal to create an interactive
interface. State management with useState ensures real-time updates and validation of
user inputs, preventing incorrect submissions. The form includes fields for name, email,
password, student ID, gender, and class selection, with validation checks to enhance data
accuracy. Instead of traditional pickers, a modal-based selection provides a smoother user
experience. Upon successful submission, the form navigates the user to the Home page
using Expo Router, demonstrating efficient form handling and navigation in a React
Native environment
